## Introduction
A Python 2D side-scrolling game, remastered/sequel to the first generation, featuring smoother animations, better performance, improved textures, and enhanced gameplay. The project is currently in early development.

## Storyline
In an era of chaos, the world was torn apart by endless conflicts, and technological progress had ground to a halt. Yet, a group of like-minded scientists came together, determined to break these chains. After countless days and nights of effort, we finally succeeded in building a time machine. Just as we were celebrating our achievement, beings who called themselves the "Advanced Civilization" descended upon us.

They mocked us as a "lower civilization," seized the time machine, and erased the memories of the other scientists—leaving only me behind to face this shattered world alone. They claimed we were unworthy of such power, but I knew the truth: they feared our rise!

Thus, I embarked on a solitary journey to search for the scattered remnants of spacecraft across the world, collecting their fragments to rebuild our technology. Now, this mission falls to you.

In this level-based combat and progression game, you will travel to different countries and regions, battling various enemies to collect spacecraft fragments. Each fragment contains immense energy, allowing you to upgrade your equipment and skills, bringing you closer to your ultimate goal.

Once you gather enough fragments to reconstruct a complete spacecraft, you will journey to other planets in search of the time machine's remnants. There, you will face even stronger foes and greater challenges, but you will also uncover secrets hidden deep in the cosmos.

In the end, you will confront the emissaries of the "Advanced Civilization." After a fierce battle, they will have no choice but to acknowledge your strength and reveal the truth: they took the time machine to prevent war and maintain peace. Now that you possess the power to control it, they will offer you a choice:

- **Take the secrets of the time machine** and pass them to your descendants. One day, they may restart it to explore the mysteries of time—but at the risk of igniting war.
- **Seal it away forever**, ensuring peace but abandoning the pursuit of temporal knowledge.

Your decision will shape the future of this world—will it be peace or endless chaos? The choice is yours.
